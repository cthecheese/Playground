Introduction
*/
	The following document contains a general overview of all the functionalities needed to get the engine itself running. The simulator itself will work of a isometric view but many of the core features should be able to run regardless of the engine involved.

/*
Caveats
*/
	While handlers are a big part of the system, they are not required for the system to work! They are meant to be used as libraries to deal with common tasks. If you donâ€™t like the way a handler works, you have two options. First is creating your own handler and the second is to just hardcode how something works.

	Handlers will be made possible later on in the game, for now they are just cumbersome and not worth the time, nor effort to getting the simulator up and running.
